# web-scraping-challenge
### This is an assignment for the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. It involved scraping different types of data through Python's Chrome extension. The code for the scraping was first written in a jupyter notebook file, then copied over to a py file with a few adjustments. An app.py file was then created to import the scrape file and perform the scrape itself and saving the data scraped to a dictionary. To display the data that was scraped, an html file was written to display it in a webpage. Included in the html was Bootstrap styling that had been introduced in the html portion of the boot camp. The image below is the html file after the scraping was performed.
